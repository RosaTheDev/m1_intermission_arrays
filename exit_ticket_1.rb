# TO DO:
things_i_like = ["Tesla Model S", "Tesla Model 3", "Tesla Model X", "Ford Model T", "MacbookPro", "Iphone X"]
# Create an array of six elements - content of your choosing (either integers or strings!)
puts things_i_like[2]
# Access the third element
puts things_i_like.push("Airpods")
# Add an element to the end of your array
# Add an element to index 2
# Remove the first element from your array
# Remove any duplicates that may exist in your array
# Create a second array with 3 elements
# "Sqash" the two arrays together

# BONUS since we didn't cover today ðŸ¦„
# If your array contains strings, write a sentence using each string. If it contains integers, create a multiplication table for your array.
